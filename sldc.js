// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = `This process is for determiming the user expecations for a new and modified product.`
let design = `The process to transform the needs of the requirements are put into detail and into a form of architecture to acheive previously stated requirements.`
let implementation = `The process that the system has been installed and is compared to performance objectives established during the planning phase. Includes user notification, user training, installation of hardware & installation of software onto production computers and integration of the system into daily work processes.`
const testingAndIntegration = `All features and updates that were planned work according to expectations and major bug issues have been resolved and bringing together the process of bringing together various types of software subsystems unified to work in one single system.`
let maintain = `Occurs after the product is in full operation. Includes software updates, repairs and fixes any bug issues and update any new products that the customer deploys.`
